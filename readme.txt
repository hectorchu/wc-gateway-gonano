Accept payments in NANO via Gonano Payments.

== Description ==

Gonano Payments is an easy-to-use payment processor for NANO that is free to use
by the community.

This lets you easily accept payments on your website without needing to know the
details of how NANO works or needing to setup a NANO node, manage wallet keys or
how to use the RPCs.

Intermediate wallet addresses are set-up automatically for your customers to pay
into, and the proceeds are automatically forwarded to your destination account.
